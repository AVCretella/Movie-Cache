      <strong>Adding a Movie To Either List</strong><br>
      <small>
        1. Using the toolbar, navigate to the list that you would like to add to. Next, select 'Add a Movie' <br>
        2. Now, enter the title of the movie that you want information about and press 'Search' <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1 For Ranked Movies: add 'Rank' (place in the list), 'Rating' (your personal rating), and 'Times Seen' <br>

      <strong>Why Do I Keep Getting - "Movie Not Found - Please Try Again'?"</strong><br>
      <small>
        1. Movie titles must be pretty accurate, first make sure that you are typing the name 100% correctly (check the ole google)<br>
        2. There may be another movie with the same title from a different year. To fix this problem, type both the movie title and the year it was made, and then press search <br>
        3. Ask Alex, maybe he can help. If he can't you're screwed, friend
